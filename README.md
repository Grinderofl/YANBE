Yet Another .NET Blog Engine


Why? Because there's never enough blog engines that are simple and allow you to use markdown.

### What is it going to be?

Simple markdown-based blog engine with very simple frontend and installation. Probably going to support both file and database-based blogs.

### What is it not going to be?

Monolithic, slow, gigantic, tons of lines of code, huge... complex to use with an overexaggerated admin panel.
